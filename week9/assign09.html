   <h3>Chapter 09: The Window Object</h3>
 <ul >
  
    <li>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.</li>
    <li>There is no official standard for the BOM, although there are a number of properties and methods that are supported by all the major browsers, making a sort of de facto standard.</li>
    <li>Global variables are actual properties of a global object. In a browser environment, the global object is the window object.</li>
    <li>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box.  </li>
    <li>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. </li>
    <li>The window object has a navigator property that returns a reference to the Navigator object. The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used.  </li>
    <li>The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of the current page. </li>
    <li>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the current browser session.  </li>
    <li>The window.screen object contains information about the screen the browser is displayed on.</li>
    <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer.  </li>
    <li>To create a cookie, you assign it to JavaScript’s “cookie jar”, using the document.cookie property.  </li>
    <li>The setTimeOut() and setInterval() methods can be used to animate elements on a web page. </li>

 </ul>
</div>




<div class = "b">
    <h3>Chapter 14: HTML5 APIs</h3>
  <ul >

  <li>The HTML5 specification is separated into modules that allow different features to be developed at different paces then implemented without having to wait for other features to be completed. </li>
  <li>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser.   </li>
  <li>The information contained in the attributes can be used to identify particular elements.  </li>
  <li>Each element has a dataset property that can be used to access any data- attributes it contains.  </li>
  <li>The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries, geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly, and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers access, and control new features that appear in the latest devices.  </li>
  <li>The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use.  </li>
  <li>If a browser supports the Web Storage API, the window object will have a property called localStorage, which is a native object with a number of properties and methods used to store data.  </li>
  <li>Every time a value is saved to local storage, a storage event is fired.  </li>

  </ul>
