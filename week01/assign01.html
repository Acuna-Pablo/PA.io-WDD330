 <h2>Notes</h2>
 
 <div class = "b">
 <ul >
        <li>We are communicating with the customer in our application.</li>
        <li>Our application has to be directional.</li> 
        <li>When an application stops, anything has been working is gone, unless it was designed to store what it has done. </li>
        <li>Store/Shared= Output</li>
        <li>Info comes in = Input</li>
        <li>Input/Output= IO.</li>

        <li>We have to think correctly if not the user will have a terrible experience.</li>
        <li>We need to adapt us to new technologies.</li>
        <li>Paradigm shift skyrocketed in 2011 because of new mobile devices. </li>
        <li>Everything that we do have to be viewable to the devices. </li>
        <li>People replaced devices every 4-5 years before.</li>
        <li>With new devices customers change device every 2 years, and some each year. </li>
        <li>Devices per household increase from 1-2 to 3-4.</li>
        <li>To do a full rebuild is costly.</li>
        <li>Provides a better experience for the user. </li>
        <li>My thinking to create something mobile first will help us to grow.</li>
        <li>We have to start small and scale up. </li>
        <li>Mobile is not a fad.</li>
        <li>We can improve customer experience by being there through their journey, useful ( provide them with what they came for), 
        quick ( interaction must be smooth) and reachability matters (easy to use).</li>
        <li>Speed matters: we can reduce images, SVG web fronts are lower bandwidth, optimize and minify CSS and its files, and 
        we can use GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data. </li>
        <li>Primary control: Do control easy to reach for user. Simple and fluid. Mobile is evolving quickly.</li>
        <li>Mobile input will help us to increase sales if it is easy to use. </li>
        <li>Mobile advertising: small and simple, stop using pop â€“ ups, and think outside the box. </li>
 </ul>
